# Software Development

Information technology (IT) is basically everything involving manipulating information using computer. There are 2 main parts of a computer, the hardware and the software. The hardware is the physical device that form the shape of a computer. Software is the collection of data, that tells the computer what to do. Based on its purpose, software can be classified into several types, application software, system software (operating systems, device drivers, utilities), and malicious software of malware. Most people would refer to application software when they thought of the term software.

With the development of technology, the need for good and supporting software in our daily life is becoming more and more essential. With that, the need for software engineer or programmer is really high. Programmer refers to people who design and create the code which creates the program using particular programming language. 

Software development is the process of writing and maintaining the source code which creates the program. The process itself may include research, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in the final products. The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development.

Most software developers follow the same methodologies:
- Analyzing the problem
- Market research
- Gathering requirements for the proposed business solution
- Devising a plan or design for the software-based solution
- Implementation (coding) of the software
- Testing the software
- Deployment
- Maintenance and bug fixing 

When developing the software, it usually starts with identifying what kind of program is needed, which can be acquired through market research. After planning and designing what kind of program to make, developers will go into the next step, writing the code itself, which consist of implementation, testing, and documentation. In this step, developers will literally write the program, and following it with testing and documenting the program for future references. When the program is tested and approved, it is ready to be deployed to users, which will be assisted by the developers through maintenance.

One of many tools which has immense impact on developers is the integrated development environment or IDE. IDE is a software which helps developers to write, compile, and debug the code. IDEs are designed to maximize developers’ productivity and it is usually tailored to particular programming language.

Among the software development industry, developers can have different methods and values, which may be personal or organizational. Agile software development is one where they highly value self-organizing and cross-functional teams, efficient communication, quality focus, and continuous introspection. One of the agile process framework for managing particularly complex knowledge work is called Scrum. Scrum is designed for little teams, around ten people or less, whose work are broken down into short iterations no longer than one month, called sprints, and then track and re-plan progress in daily meetings. In scrum, there are 3 roles: product owner (representing the product’s stakeholders, development team (consisting of everyone who is involved in the development and support of the product), and scrum master (acting as the mediator between the two parties, and making sure everyone is following the scrum framework correctly). 

Extreme programming (XP) is one of agile software development’s type, whose practices are taken to the extreme levels. In this method, programmers are paired so they can continuously do extensive code review. Extreme programming is intended as a discipline which organizes developers to produce higher-quality software more productively. There are 4 basic activities in this method: coding, testing, listening, designing. XP highly values communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect for the teams. In this practice, the developers are demanded to always accept feedback, assume simplicity, and embrace change.
